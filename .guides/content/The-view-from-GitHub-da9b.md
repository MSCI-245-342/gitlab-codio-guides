1. Go to https://github.com/UWaterlooMSCI342 and either find your repo or click on "Teams" and your team name and then "Repositories" to find your repo.  Click on your repo name.

1. Notice that the README.md file, does not show your changes.  This is because you are viewing the main branch, and your changes are on the `adding-names` branch.

1. You will see a dropdown button that has a mini commit graph and the name "main" on it.  This button lets you select the branch you want to view in GitHub.  Click the button and select "adding-names".  You should see the README.md change to match the work you committed and pushed. 

1. There should be a message that says "This branch is 1 commit ahead, 1 commit behind main."  To the right of that message are links for "Pull Request" and "Compare".  Click on "Compare".

1. Look down the page (scroll as needed), and you can see the differences between the main branch and the adding-names branch.  If it looks like you expect, click the big green button "Create pull request"

1. For now, you don't need to add a comment, but for the project, we'll give you guidance on how to write a good pull request (PR).  Click again "Create pull request".

1. Your pull request needs to be reviewed by another team member before your PR can be merged with main.  I recommend that you click the little "gear" icon next to "reviewers" and select each of your teammates for a review.  Each of them will get an email telling them that you'd like a review of your PR.
