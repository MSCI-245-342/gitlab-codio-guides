### Clone the repo

Each teammate should, in their own Codio terminal, clone the repo:

```
git clone git@github.com:UWaterlooMSCI342/W22-gitlab-team-NNN.git
```

where you make sure to replace `NNN` with your team number.  You should now find a directory named W22-gitlab-team-NNN with the README.md file in it.
