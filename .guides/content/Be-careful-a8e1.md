### Protected "main" branch

Now, because the `main` branch is protected, it is VERY IMPORTANT that you **NEVER commit anything to the main branch**.  You MUST always first create a branch or switch to a branch before you do any work in your repository.  If you commit to the `main` branch, you will put your local repository into a state that is tricky to fix.
